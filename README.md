# Erl Wood KNIME

## Synopsis

The features include [KNIME](https://knime.com) nodes for working with authenticated file shares, other utility code and nodes geared towards pharmaceutical research with an emphasis on medicinal and computational chemistry. The nodes typically focus on SAR data manipulation and interpretation but also include generic tools such as a 2D/3D scatterplot viewer and extended Excel nodes.

For developers, we also include a framework for simplification of chemical structure conversion, node interface development, web service integration and enterprise authentication.

The code is structured as a collection of [KNIME](https://knime.com) extensions which consistute [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) plugins and features implemented in [Java](https://java.com) built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Tycho](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/).

## Motivation

These nodes have been developed by the Research IT and Computational Drug Discovery groups at Erl Wood, United Kingdom. They are provided for free as part of Eli Lillyâ€™s KNIME precompetitive strategy towards improving the efficiency of drug design worldwide.

## Installation

These features can be installed directly into your KNIME client.
