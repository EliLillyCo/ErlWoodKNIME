    <shortDescription>
        A viewer for networks of molecules.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Structures and activities of molecules is best viewed in the context of chemical neighbourhood.
        In the network view, molecules are represented by nodes coloured according to chosen property. A pair of nodes is
        connected based on an edge similarity cutoff provided in options. The edge is coloured in green if the ratio of activity difference to
        chemical distance is higher than the "cliff" cutoff set in options.

        <option name="PropertColunm">Choose the (double) column to take the molecular property/activity from.</option>
        <option name="SmilesColunm">Choose the column containing smiles strings of the molecules.</option>
        <option name="MolNameColunm">Choose the column containing names of molecules, such as LSN.</option>
        <option name="EdgeCutoff">Edges will be drawn for pairs of molecules closer in chemical space than this cutoff.</option>
        <option name="CliffCutoff">Edges will be coloured green if this edge is a cliff, i.e. has a high difference in property as compared to chemistry.</option>
