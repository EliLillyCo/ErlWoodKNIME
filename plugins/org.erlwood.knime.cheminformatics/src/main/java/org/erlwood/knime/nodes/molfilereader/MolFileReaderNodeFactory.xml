    <name>Chemical Structures File Reader</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
    	Reads chemical structures from a file.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Use this node to read chemical structures stored on your hard drive.
			Different file formats are supported. These include, but are not limited to,
			Chemical Markup Language (CML) files; a number of Symyx (former MDL) formats -
			mol, sdf, rdf; SMILES; Tripos mol2 files; pdb; xyz; etc. See
			http://www.chemaxon.com/marvin/help/formats/formats.html for an extensive list.
        </intro>
       <option name="Select file(s)">
 			Use the Add and Remove buttons to add to the list of files to process. Changing the list will automatically tigger a scan in either shallow or deep mode.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Scan Depth">
 			Shallow scan is the first 10 records of each file, whilst a deep scan will scan each file completely for properties.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Properties to keep">
        	All molecular properties found in the first 10 records of the input file are
        	presented in the left-hand side list. Use the provided controls to select the
        	properties you are interested in. These will be read and stored in the output
        	of the node. Note that all properties are treated as strings - in the likely
        	case that some or all of the properties are numeric you may use the
        	'String To Number' node. The 'String To Number' node is part of the default
        	KNIME installation and may be found under the category 'Data Manipulation | Column'.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Output options -> General -> Aromatize molecules">
        	Select this option if you want the read chemical structures to be aromatized
        	using the default Chemaxon algorithm. Recommended.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Output options -> Additional columns">
        	In addition to the "native" Chemaxon Molecule object a number of columns
        	containing different text-based representations of the read molecules can be
        	created as well. These are useful when an interaction with another
        	chemoinformatics package is needed. For example, to use this reader with the
        	CDK library (since it supports much more file formats) you can output an SDF
        	column which can than be processed by CDK.
        </option>
    </fullDescription>
    
    <ports>
        <outPort index="0" name="Read Molecules Output">
        	The read chemical structures are output here. A column containing Chemaxon
        	Molecule objects is always present. Depending on the configuration, a number of
        	other columns - representing the read molecules in another string-based format
        	or containing properties read from the input file - may be present as well.
        </outPort>
        <outPort index="1" name="Failed to Read Molecules Output">
			The  chemical molecules that failed to read are output here.
