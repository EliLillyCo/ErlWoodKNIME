    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
Compares rows using user specified columns and pairs up any two rows which
 differ only in user specified number of columns. Optionally, for each pair 
 calculates the differences/ratios between user specified properties.
		</intro>
        
 <!--       <option name="Values to subtract for each pair">
For each pair of rows formed the absolute value of the difference between this
 property is stored. See also "Highlight differences using".
        </option>-->
        <option name="Highlight differences using">
The node appends three columns to the original input table. The first contains 
 the number of pairs in which the row participates while the second and the 
 third contain the row key of the other row in the pair and the property 
 difference for this "best" pair. The "best" pair may be either the one with 
 the "Maximum" or "Minimum" absolute difference between the selected property.  
        </option>
        <!--<option name="Number of differences to pair up rows">
Specify exactly how many columns in two rows should differ for these rows to
 form a pair.
        </option>-->
		<option name="Column to output in pairs">
Select a column (or the row ids) which to use in the "Pairs" table, i.e., the
 second output port,see below.
        </option>
        <option name="also invert output">
not only the match pair "mol1->mol2" is written, but also the pair "mol2->mol1"
        </option>

    <ports>
        <inPort index="0" name="Data Input">
Regular data table. No constraints are imposed on it.
        </inPort>
        
        <!--  outPort index="0" name="Input Data + 'Best' Pair Info">
The input table with three columns attached. "Number of Pairs" tells you in how
 many pairs this particular row participates. "Highlighted Pair With" gives you
 the row id of the other member of the "best" pair (see "Highlight differences
 using" above). "Highlighted Diff" gives you the absolute value of the 
 difference between the property you have selected in the 'best' pair.  
        </outPort -->
        
        <outPort index="0" name="Matched Output">
A table with all matched pairs.
        </outPort>
