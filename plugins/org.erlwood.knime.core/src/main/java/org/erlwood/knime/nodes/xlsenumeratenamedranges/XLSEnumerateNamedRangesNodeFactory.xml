        Enumerates sheet names and named ranges (cell reference ranges) contained in a workbook.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node reads a workbook and provides the contained sheet and named range names at its output port.<br />
			The performance of the reader node is limited (due to the underlying library
			of the Apache POI project). Reading large files takes a very long time and uses a
			lot of memory (especially files in xlsx format).   		
		</intro>
		<option name="File to read">
			Enter a valid file name. You can also choose a previously
			selected file from the drop-down list, or select a file from
			the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog. Supported are xls and xlsx file 
			formats. (Note: reading large xlsx files is very slow and memory consuming.)
