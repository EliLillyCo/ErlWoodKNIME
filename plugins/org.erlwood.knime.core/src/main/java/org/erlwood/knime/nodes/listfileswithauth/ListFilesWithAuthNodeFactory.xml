			This node creates a list with the UNC locations and Samba URLs of the
			files contained in one or more given folders (content of sub folders
			can be listed as well). It is possible to apply a filter on the 
			files, so that only the files of interests are included in the 
			resulting list.	There are 3 filters available: file 
			extension(s), wildcard pattern or regular expression.
			<br /><br />
			
			<p>Authentication: To use the network functionality of this node you must specify
			workflow credentials. This node will not automatically use your 
			local login credentials.</p>
